    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        During foundations, we spent time doing some self exploration and self evaluation.  Although I am familiar with many of the things covered, there were parts that were new and fascinating for me.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When we spent time with the Māori theory of holistic health, Te Whare Tapa Whā, and it had a unique perspective that was new for me and something that I value having the time to think about and gather my approach for solidifying my "four walls" and their connection to the earth/nature. This exercise took me from thinking "I know this about myself" at first glance to "I'm glad I took the time to think about these things in this way".  It shows me again the value of being open to other perspectives.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        What I thought was and issue of the past still lingers.  That would be my reluctance to ask for help.  I still have this desire to solve issues myself and my ego doesn't want me to look like I don't know what I am doing. I still have room to grow in this area and waste my time running in circles.  I eventually will either solve the issue (in more time than asking for help) or ask for help and then move on when I could have asked for help and gotten through it in less time. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Revsisting Emotional Intelligence, also known as EQ, was good for me.  I realize that I have changed a lot since I last did any evaluating of my EQ and using the tools provided, discovered that a number of EQ qualities have evolved.

    <h2 class="subheading" id="role">Role of Values, Empathy & Self-Awareness for Learning and Coding</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        One's values, ability to empathise and the self-awareness they have impact both learning and coding.  The values one holds impact motivation for learning and for what one creates in code.  
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Contrary to the opion that some hold, learning and coding is often a team endeavor and not purely solo.  This means that empathy and one's ability to empathise can be crucial to success.  For learning, empathy, in my experience, let's you have insight into anothers confidence, confusion or other emotions that inform you of opportunities to learn or teach and at the very least to appreciate the other perspective.  In coding, being able to have insight into a team members emotions can point to the best way to contribute to the coding effort, such as in paired programming, knowing when it is best to be the driver or the navigator and when it may be best to step back and talk through the objective of the current coding effort.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Lastly, but perhaps more importantly, one's level of self-awareness will greatly impact one's ability to learn or productively code.  When learning, knowing what you need to deeply engage in the act of learning is immensely helpful.  If you know how you learn best and engage in that learning style, the more likely you will quickly aquire and master what you are learning.  
        <br/>

        At first I felt frustrated with not getting output I expected and could not understand why the output was undefined and the filer method I was using was not firing.  As I got more frustrated the code got more convoluted as I tried different things.  When I finally determined I was too stuck to make progress and needed to get perspective I stepped back and let the problem flow in the back of mind as I did other things.  When I was in the right frame of mind the solution appeared and flowed eaily and cleanly.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        From this examination of my problem solving, I realize that I need to be conscious of when my frustration is overriding my ability to think clearly, I will benefit from getting up from the keyboard and letting the possible solution work through my mind until I am in a clearer state and able to view the problem and solution without the interference of my frustration.

    <h2 class="subheading" id="types">Types of Solutions</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <ul class="paragraph">
        <li>
          <span>Pseudocode</span> is essential for problem solving, especially when I am trying to do something new or something that I haven't done for while.  This is technique is something I am comfortable with but need to use more often.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Trying something</span> is my intitial go to when I feel like I know what needs to be done.  I will jump into the problem and try what I remember.  Sometimes this works.  Often it will give me a good start on a solution.  Occassionally I will get off on the wrong foot and it forces me to rethink my approach and usually I step back and then start with pseudocode.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Rubber ducky method</span> is a technique that I use particularly when I am working with other people.  I should use it more often when I am working solo because saying the solution out loud often helps me see what needs to be done differently.  This is a technique that I need to implement more when working alone but is common when I am working in a pair or team.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Reading error messages</span> is so very helpful to me.  Often using the stack trace will point me to the precise location of the error and through pattern recognition I can sometimes quickly see the problem and easily fix the bug.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Console.logging</span> is another essential tool for me in my problem solving kit.  I frequently will pop a console.log() into my code to make sure I am getting what I expect out of my code.  I can't imagine not using this technique when coding.  It's the window that lets one see what the computer sees.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Googling</span> is the king of syntax help.  If I don't know or can't recall how to do something, Googling is the go to tool.  In particualr using the Mozzilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation is particularly helpful as is Stack Overlfow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Asking your peers for help</span> is something I feel comfortable with but can be resistant too.  I tend to want to "solve it myself" which can be inefficient.  I need to become better at this.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Asking coaches for help</span> like asking peers for help, this is something I feel comfortable with but can be resistant too and is always my last line of problem solving.  I tend to want to "solve it myself" which can be inefficient.  I need to become better at this.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Improving your process with reflection</span> is something I use and am comfortable with but need to get better at implementing in a more timely fashion.  It works really well for me but my stubbornness and deisre to "solve it now" gets in the way as does my ego.  What I have to realize is that I am not giving up, I am simply stepping away and then mentally working on it without distraction.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="subheading" id="help">Asking for Help</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        When working with some more basic coding I ran into an issue where I was getting back an undefined result.  These issues are typically easier to find and solve.  In this case I ran into the problem over and over again and kept thinking "don't ask for help, you can figure it out. This isn't your first time coding. You'll look ignorant.  Only ask if you can't solve it with another solution."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This turned out to be highly inefficient and a total waste of time.  When I asked I was given the simple solution in a matter of moments but just as I asked the question I saw the solution.  Sometimes when asking the question I relax and can see the problem.  Other times I truly need the insight of someone else. In short, I need to be better at asking for help in a more timely fashion.
