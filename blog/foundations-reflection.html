    <h2 class="subheading" id="three">Three Things About Myself</h2> 
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        During foundations, we spent time doing some self exploration and self evaluation.  Although I am familiar with many of the things covered, there were parts that were new and fascinating for me.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        When we spent time with the Māori theory of holistic health, Te Whare Tapa Whā, and it had a unique perspective that was new for me and something that I value having the time to think about and gather my approach for solidifying my "four walls" and their connection to the earth/nature. This exercise took me from thinking "I know this about myself" at first glance to "I'm glad I took the time to think about these things in this way".  It shows me again the value of being open to other perspectives.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        What I thought was and issue of the past still lingers.  That would be my reluctance to ask for help.  I still have this desire to solve issues myself and my ego doesn't want me to look like I don't know what I am doing. I still have room to grow in this area and waste my time running in circles.  I eventually will either solve the issue (in more time than asking for help) or ask for help and then move on when I could have asked for help and gotten through it in less time. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Revsisting Emotional Intelligence, also known as EQ, was good for me.  I realize that I have changed a lot since I last did any evaluating of my EQ and using the tools provided, discovered that a number of EQ qualities have evolved.

    <h2 class="subheading" id="role">Role of Values, Empathy & Self-Awareness for Learning and Coding</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        One's values, ability to empathise and the self-awareness they have impact both learning and coding.  The values one holds impact motivation for learning and for what one creates in code.  
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Contrary to the opion that some hold, learning and coding is often a team endeavor and not purely solo.  This means that empathy and one's ability to empathise can be crucial to success.  For learning, empathy, in my experience, let's you have insight into anothers confidence, confusion or other emotions that inform you of opportunities to learn or teach and at the very least to appreciate the other perspective.  In coding, being able to have insight into a team members emotions can point to the best way to contribute to the coding effort, such as in paired programming, knowing when it is best to be the driver or the navigator and when it may be best to step back and talk through the objective of the current coding effort with your partner.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Lastly, but perhaps more importantly, one's level of self-awareness will greatly impact one's ability to learn or productively code.  When learning, knowing what you need to deeply engage in the act of learning is immensely helpful.  If you know how you learn best and engage in that learning style, the more likely you will quickly aquire and master what you are learning.  
      </p>

    <h2 class="subheading" id="surprised">Surprised by Core Content</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        The time spent with neuroplasticity and growth mindset was a pleasant surprise.  Dr. Carol Dwek and her co-researchers have done amazing research and greatly impacted people and learning as well as self confidence.  It really was valuable to take the time and dive into all that has been done in the area of neuroplasticity and the concept of a growth mindset.  While I was aware of this, I haven't delved too deeply into it for some time and it was really good to revisit it.  I know that this preparation will help when the inevitable impostor syndrome comes knocking during the Bootcamp.

    <h2 class="subheading" id="challenge">Challenging</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        I would say that the most challenging part for me was to take the time to really invest in the core material.  I have had a long and successful enough career and learned many of the things taught in this curriculm and put them into practice.  However, when I stepped back and looked at the material with a fresh perspective, I found a lot of value in revisiting this material. Overcoming the knee jerk reaction of "why am I doing this again?  I spent time with this years ago..." was the most challenging part for me.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheading" id="why">Why Teach Core?</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        For me, the focus on core material is to assist graduates with developing ALL of the competencies that a future employer would want.  When an employer looks at candidates they are not only concerned with your technical knowledge and skills.  In fact that is only a small part of it. As a former employer I focus on the technical knowledge to meet minimums for interviewing a candidates.  At the interview and selection stage the most important factor was attitude and cultural fit with the organization.  It is much easier to teach technical skills and much harder to change a person into someone that fits with the organization.  The core material taught in Foundations should put students on the right path toward employability.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        After all, if you can build great websites but can't get along with others and cause pandemonium among your peers, it doesn't bode well for your investment and your reputation.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheading" id="worth">Is the Core Content Worth the Time and Effort?</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        I initially struggled with appreciating the core content. I felt that as a late career changer with deep experience and application of much of the core curriculum that it would not benefit me. I have enough experience and enough self-awareness to realise that just because I have learned some of it and used some of it, revisiting it, working the fundamentals and exploring what new things have developed as well as the New Zealand perspective is always going to benefit me.
