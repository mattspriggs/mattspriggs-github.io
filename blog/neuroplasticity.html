      The Beneifit of Understanding Neroplasticity
    </h2>

        The guru of the concept of neuroplasticity,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck" class="blogLink"
          >Dr. Carol Dwek</a
        >, has studied and provided an important concept for human growth and
        potential - the brain is NOT fixed at birth but is instead maleable and
        adapts and changes through out a person's life <br /><br />
        Understanding that the brain is not a static, hard set part of the body
        opens up the possibility for anyone to improve at things, even just by
        imagining and mentally performing that thing. This means that anyone can
        engage with learning a skill when they understand that engaging in that
        thing will have benefits and improvement. <br /><br />
        Dr. Dwek's research has shown that while physically engaging in that
        activity will have greater improvement, it is possible to practice it
        mentally when not engaged in the activity and still improve that skill.
        Mentally engaging in the skill will accelerate your improvement when you
        do engage in that activity physically again later. The gains from
        physically engaging in the activity post mental engagement are greater
        than without that period of mental engagement.

          From an article from

            class="blogLink"
            >Accelerate Learning Community of the University of Utah</a
          >, there are 5 key components to engaging your in neuroplasticity:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Challenge & Novelty:</span> it should be a skill that is new
            to you and not too easy to learn. This is essential for creating
            change in your brain
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Intention:</span> The skill must have some kind of meaning,
            relevance or importance to you. The idea of gaining something of
            value from engaging in this new skill will keep you engaged when it
            becomes difficult
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Specific Attention:</span> Skills that are practiced tend to
            improve and the more a person focusses on the tasks the more likely
            change will occur.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Repetition & Intensity:</span> Short bouts of intense
            repetition are needed to create new neural connections. Doing
            something once is not likely to be sufficient.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Time:</span> Neuroplastic change takes time for real
            structural and functional change to occur in the brain and the body.
            It is also normal to hit periods of plateaus while the change is
            being shaped. It is best to keep at it to overcome a plateau.

    <h2 class="subheading" id="growth">Growth Mindset</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        A <span>Growth Mindset</span> is the belief that people are good at
        things where they have built that ability, whereas those who are not
        good at it have not put in the work. In short you are in control of your
        abilities and your abilities are not fixed. The growth mindset is based
        with the understaing of neuroplasticity and the focus on the ability to
        build skills by re putting in deliberate effort. A growth mindset is
        essential for continually improving.

          With a growth mindset:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Belief - One believes that skills are built and you can learn and
            grow in a deliberate way
          </li>
          <li>
            Focus - The focus is on the process of getting better, not on
            proving you are competent
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Key ingredients for growth:</li>

            <li><span>Effort</span> - Is useful and leads to growth</li>
            <li>
              <span>Challenges</span> - Embrace and perservere through
              challenges and frame the challenge as an opportunity
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Mistakes</span> - Use them to learn from and don't be afraid
              of them
            </li>
            <li><span>Feedback</span> - Appreciate and use feedback</li>

        While I had an idea of both neuroplasticity and growth mindset, this
        exploration really increased my understanding and my curiousity about
        it. I found some really useful things to add to my ability to improve
        and learn.

        While I generally have a growth mindset already, being intentional about
        maintaining and increasing the growth mindset that I have will deeply
        benefit me.

    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        The most important thing that both neuroplasticity and growth mindset
        will impact is removing or at least taming my inner critic. If there is
        anything that negatively impacts my ability to improve it is my slipping
        into the belief that I am not capable of learning or getting better. The
        impact of the self critic comes from a familial culture of "there is
        always someone better, faster and smarter" which plays against the idea
        that you can improve anything if you put in the work with attention and
        intention.
