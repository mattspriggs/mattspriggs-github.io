      The Beneifit of Understanding Neroplasticity
    </h2>

      <p class="paragraph">
        The guru of the concept of neuroplasticity,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck"
          ><span>Dr. Carol Dwek</span></a
        >, has studied and provided an important concept for human growth and
        potential - the brain is NOT fixed at birth but is instead maleable and
        adapts and changes through out a person's life <br /><br />
        Understanding that the brain is not a static, hard set part of the body
        opens up the possibility for anyone to improve at things, even just by
        imagining and mentally performing that thing. This means that anyone can
        engage with learning a skill when they understand that engaging in that
        thing will have benefits and improvement. <br /><br />
        Dr. Dwek's research has shown that while physically engaging in that
        activity will have greater improvement, it is possible to practice it
        mentally when not engaged in the activity and still improve that skill.
        Mentally engaging in the skill will accelerate your improvement when you
        do engage in that activity physically again later. The gains from
        physically engaging in the activity post mental engagement are greater
        than without that period of mental engagement.

              To deal with stress and potential conflicts, I will not react in
