        As a serial entrepreneur, I hope to eventually be able to either be a
        part of a start-up or launch my own full stack web development firm. I
        also have an interest in doing game development but feel that full stack
        development is a better path for me to start from.

        <span>STRENGTHS:</span> <br />I have really strong
        <span>self discipline</span>; can work <span>independently</span> or
        <span>collaboratively</span>; enjoy <span>problem solving</span> and

        <span>growth mind set</span>. <br /><br />
        <span>LIMITATIONS:</span> <br />I can be a
        <span>perfectionist</span> and <span>overwork</span>. Another cosistent
        issue is <span>not taking breaks</span> when I should. I am also
        <span>TERRIBLE</span> at <span>asking for help</span>.

          I commit to:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Start work by 8 AM and end no later than 8 PM unless I am in

            </li>
            <li>
              For every 4 hours I work I will take a minimum of a 15 minute
              break AWAY FROM THE KEYBOARD.
            </li>
            <li>
              To deal with stress and potential conflicts, I will not react in
              the moment but instead will step back, listen and try to
              understand before responding.

        I commit to asking for help from my fellow cohort members after I am

        I expect the facilitators to guide me to resources to help me solve my

        hand me solution unless I am at my wits end.

        I will spend my mornings doing my morning routine of exercise, etcetera
        and that is non-negotiable for me. The only other commitments I may have
        will be around appointments. There are no other regular commitments that
        I have not cleared.
