        As a serial entrepreneur, I hope to eventually be able to either be a
        part of a start-up or launch my own full stack web development firm. I
        also have an interest in doing game development but feel that full stack
        development is a better path for me to start from. It may also make
        sense to work for someone while I adapt to being in a new career field
        and new to the New Zealand culture.<br /><br />
        I am concerned that as a professional with a long history and as a new
        migrant to New Zealand that my age, experience and not having New
        Zealand work history, may work against me and could push me into work
        outside of tech (again).
        <br /><br />
        I will need to keep tabs on what I can expect in the job market and/or
        as an entrepreneur as the bootcamp comes to an end. Thankfully there
        will be 2 weeks at the end to focus on this exact thing.

    <h2 class="subheading" id="strength">Strengths & Limitations</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <ul class="paragraph">
        <li><span>Strengths</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My strenghts continue to be what I believed them to be during
            foundations:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I have strong <span>self-discipline</span> and have demonstrated
              it many times and in many ways in the past.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have years of work and academic study in remote, hybrid and
              onsite locations. This means that I can and enjoy working in all
              of those environments. I work well both
              <span>independently</span> and <span>collaboratively</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              I really enjoy <span>problem solving</span> and coding certainly
              provides many opportunities to problem solve!
            </li>
            <li>
              I am a very creative person and enjoy seeing ideas come to life.
              This will provide me with continual drive throughout the bootcamp.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am a life long learner, having more formal education than is
              probably advisable. I really enjoy learning. Having a focus on
              <span>continual learning</span> has required me to adopt a
              <span>growth mindset</span>. This is not always easy to maintain,
              but I have had success in the past and believe I will be able to
              continue to do this successfully during the bootcamp.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><span>Limitations</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Similar to my strengths, I anticipate that my limitations will
            continue to be very much the same as they were during Foundations:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              My <span>perfectionism</span> can definitely get in the way. I
              tend to work on things too long with only minimal improvements,
              when I could have simply let it be "good enough".
            </li>
            <li>
              My <span>perfectionism</span> can also drive me to
              <span>overwork</span>. This includes
              <span>not taking breaks</span> when I should and working too long.
            </li>
            <li>
              Perhaps my biggest potential issue is
              <span>not asking for help in a timely fashion</span>. I tend to
              want to figure out solutions on my own, even when I can't see my
              way to the end after spending significant time working on it. I
              will need to be very cognizant of this during the bootcamp.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><span>Non-Technical Limitations</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I am lucky in that I have no anticipated non-technical limitations
            that I anticipate during the bootcamp. My fiƒÅnce knows what this
            will entail and she is very supportive of my particiaption in the
            bootcamp, despite it consuming many of my avaialble hours.
          </li>

    <h2 class="subheading" id="soft">Soft Skill Development</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        The most important soft skill for me to develop during the bootcamp, is
        a better understanding of New Zealand culture and work place norms and
        how I can fit into it without trying to change who I am. As a new
        migrant, this will be critical for me to successfully assimilate into my
        new country and home.

    <div class="section">
      <ul class="paragraph">
        <li><span>Expectations of the Bootcamp Team</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I have the expectation that the bootcamp team will ber available to
            provide guidance and to provide an intensive but supportive learning
            experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            I do not, and prefer not, to have them solve my problems for me
            unless I clearly have indicated that I need them to.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li><span>Self Expectations</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I expect that I will set and keep to schedule, take regular breaks
            away from the computer and make sure that I get enough sleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            I expect myself to listen and understand others before seeking to be
            understood.
          </li>
          <li>
            I expect that I will work collaboratively whenever it is possible. I
            find that I learn a lot from working with others and if I find an
            opportunity to teach someone something, it further solidifies my own
            understanding of that thing.
