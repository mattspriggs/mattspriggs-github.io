      <p class="paragraph">
        Most people have had exposure to web pages through the use of a device -
        smart phone, laptop or desktop computer or a tablet. When you open up a
        browser on your device, it will load, usually, a web page that connects
        your device to the greater internet (also known as the World Wide Web),
        and that page is referred to as a search engine. It is also just a web page that is interactive.<br /><br />

        From the moment you open your web browser, you are viewing a web page
        that has a consistent structure as its foundation which is known as a document. The document is the consistent basis for
        every webpage you view. But the document itself is just a blank canvas with a bunch of rules that you can't see.
        <br /><br />
        What you see is likely instructions from three interrelated programming
        languages that decide <ul class="paragraph">
        <li>the structure and content (<span>HTML</span>);</li> <li>how the
        page is organized and styled (color, fonts,
        placement, size, etc.)(<span>CSS</span>);</li> <li>how you can interact with with the page
        (<span>JavaScript</span>).</li>

        <span>LIMITATIONS:</span> <br />I can be a

            <li>
              For every 4 hours I work I will take a minimum of a 15 minute

            <li>
              To deal with stress and potential conflicts, I will not react in
              the moment but instead will step back, listen and try to
              understand before responding.

        I have not cleared.
