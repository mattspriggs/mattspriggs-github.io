    <h3 class="subheading">What Forms The World Wide Web</h3>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Most people have had exposure to web pages through the use of a device -
        smart phone, laptop or desktop computer or a tablet. When you open up a
        browser on your device, it will load, usually, a web page that connects
        your device to the greater internet (also known as the World Wide Web),
        and that page is referred to as a search engine. It is also just a web
        page that is interactive. That web page, like all other pages, is built
        on a consistent foundation known as a document.<br /><br />

        The document is the consistent basis for every webpage you view. But the
        document itself is just a blank canvas with a bunch of rules that you
        can't see. This document is a sort of scaffolding that is described as
        an object. An object in coding is a way of describing in code what a
        real world object might look like. The document is such an object.
        Objects are are model or representation of that real life thing. So the
        foundation of a web page is referred to as the Document Object Model or
        DOM.

    <h2 class="subheading" id="js">JavaScript's Control of the DOM</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        What you see on the web is likely instructions from three interrelated
        programming languages that reside on the DOM that determine the
        structure and content (<span>HTML</span>); how the page is organized and
        styled (color, fonts, placement, size, etc.)(<span>CSS</span>); and how
        you can interact with with the page (<span>JavaScript</span>).
        <br /><br />
        A web page can be created with HTML and CSS alone. These web pages are
        not very efficient and are rather dull. JavaScript, on the other hand,
        can create interaction for the user, change the HTML and CSS and create
        depth to the web page. In a way, HTML and CSS are like a flat paper
        printer. A 2D printed page may look nice, convey a message and important
        information but not much else. JavaScript would be taking the concept of
        printing on 2D paper and creating a 3D print that you could interact
        with.
        <br /><br />
        So while HTML and CSS are important, JavaScript is what will control the
        what interation the DOM provides.

    <h2 class="subheading" id="control">Control Flow and Loops</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Like things that are routine in our lives, coding for a website relies
        on a certain flow and, in some cases, repetition. For example you are in
        charge of preparing a meal for four people and have to choose what meal
        it is. First you need to decide what meal is appropriate given the
        season. If its winter you might make a stew. If its summer you might
        make a salad. If one person is vegan you may need to make one of the
        meals with no animal products. In programming this is control flow,
        which is done using logic structures such as an if-then statement (see
        below).
        <br /><br />
        Once the decisions are made for the meal and assuming all four have the
        same preferences, you will need top prepare four meals that are the
        same. In coding, this is where loops come in. You instruct JavaScript to
        repeat the same action for all of the meals. This is typical done
        through a for loop which comes in a variety of syntaxes. Perhaps the
        most common is the forEach loop.

      JavaScript DOM Interactions
    </h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        One of the powers of JavaScript is its ability to interact with the
        Document Object Model (DOM). However, to access the DOM there must be a
        location to target its interaction. These targets are created through
        accessing HTML elements (tags) that are on the page and have either a
        class (classes group things together) or an id (ids are unique).
        <br /><br />
        For example, you have a button on the page that you want to change the
        label when that button is pressed. To allow JavaScript find this
        specific button you would add an id to its opening element/tag and
        "query" the document to set it as the target for JavaScript to make the
        change. When the button is clicked JavaScript will find the button and
        change the text. This is illustrated in the code snippets below.

      Getting Data From Objects & Arrays
    </h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Both objects and arrays organize and hold data that can be accessed and
        used. An object holds information through pairing a key with a value:
        <span>let obj = {key: value}</span>. An object can hold as many keys as
        there are values that form the object. <br /><br />
        Arrays are more like an ordered list of whatever values you want to
        include. Each value has an index attached to it that refers to its place
        in the list. Indexes start counting from 0 instead of 1. So the first
        position in an array is 0 not 1.
        <br /><br />
        Because they are structure differently, the way to access their data
        differs. For objects use . notation:
        <span>let objValue = object.key</span> to set the variable objValue to
        the value held by the object key. <br /><br />
        For arrays you use the name of the array followed by square brackets
        containing the index number of the data you want:
        <span>let arrValue = array[index]</span>. So to set the variable
        arrValue to the data held in the third position of the array the code
        would look like this: <span>let arrValue = array[2]</span>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheading" id="functions">Functions</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Functions are routines that you create for JavaScript to perform when
        requested. Functions are reusable code. This means that you can write it
        once and apply it anytime and anywhere you want.
