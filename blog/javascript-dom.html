    <h3 class="subheading">What Forms The World Wide Web</h3>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Most people have had exposure to web pages through the use of a device -
        smart phone, laptop or desktop computer or a tablet. When you open up a
        browser on your device, it will load, usually, a web page that connects
        your device to the greater internet (also known as the World Wide Web),
        and that page is referred to as a search engine. It is also just a web
        page that is interactive.<br /><br />

        From the moment you open your web browser, you are viewing a web page
        that has a consistent structure as its foundation which is known as a
        document. The document is the consistent basis for every webpage you
        view. But the document itself is just a blank canvas with a bunch of
        rules that you can't see.
        <br /><br />
        What you see is likely instructions from three interrelated programming
        languages that decide the structure and content (<span>HTML</span>); how
        the page is organized and styled (color, fonts, placement, size,
        etc.)(<span>CSS</span>); how you can interact with with the page
        (<span>JavaScript</span>).
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="subheading" id="js">JavaScript's Control of the DOM</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        So while a web page can be created with HTML and CSS alone, they are not
        very efficient and are rather dull. JavaScript, on the other hand, can
        create interaction for the user, change the HTML and CSS and create
        depth to the web page. In a way, HTML and CSS are like a flat paper
        printer. It may look nice, convey a message and important information
        but not much else. JavaScript would be taking the concept of printing on
        2D paper and creating a 3D print that you could interact with.
        <br /><br />
        So while HTML and CSS are important, JavaScript is what will control the
        document, the universal foundation of all web pages mentioned above, and
        referred to as the Document Object Model or DOM.

    <h2 class="subheading" id="control">Control Flow and Loops</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        Like things that are routine in our lives, coding for a website relies
        on a certain flow and, in some cases, repetition. For example you are in
        charge of preparing a meal for four people and have to choose what meal
        it is. First you need to decide what meal is appropriate given the
        season. If its winter you might make a stew. If its summer you might
        make a salad. If one person is vegan you may need to make one of the
        meals with no animal products. In programming this is control flow,
        which is done using logic structures such as an if-then statement (see
        below).
        <br /><br />
        Once the decisions are made for the meal and assuming all four have the
        same preferences, you will need top prepare four meals that are the
        same. In coding, this is where loops come in. You instruct JavaScript to
        repeat the same action for all of the meals. This is typical done
        through a for loop which comes in a variety of syntaxes. Perhaps the
        most common is the forEach loop.

              For every 4 hours I work I will take a minimum of a 15 minute

            <li>
              To deal with stress and potential conflicts, I will not react in
              the moment but instead will step back, listen and try to
              understand before responding.
