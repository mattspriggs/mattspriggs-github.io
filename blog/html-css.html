        provide similar functions but are critically different. They both
        connect HTML to CSS that styles it and/or JavaScript that powers its
        interactivity. However there is a key difference and there are best
        practices for when to use a class or an id.

        to an HTML element/tag (a part of the page) allows you to apply specific
        CSS or JavaScript effects between the opening and closing element/tag.

        <br />
        <span>CRITICAL DIFFERENCE</span><br />
        A class differs from an ID in that it can be repeated anywhere in that
        HTML document/page by simply adding the class to the opening
        element/tag. However an id is unique and is scoped "globally" for that
        HTML document/page. In simple terms, you can repeat a class within an
        HTML document/page but an id only appear once within an HTML
        document/page.
        <br />
        <br />
        <!-- HTML CODE -->
        <span>HTML Code Example</span><br />
        To assign a class and/or an id in HTML find the "opening" element/tag
        you want it to apply to and add the class and/or an id. This allows CSS
        or JavaScript to find it on the HTML page and apply the effect to the
        page that the end user views or interacts with. To apply a class in HTML
        the code would look something like this:
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="../images/class-html-code.png"
          alt="Code snippet showing a class added to an HTML element"
          class="code-snippet"
        />
        <br />
        <!-- CSS CODE -->
