        connect HTML to CSS that styles it and/or JavaScript that powers its
        interactivity. However there is a key difference and there are best

        to an HTML element/tag (a part of the page) allows you to apply specific
        CSS or JavaScript effects between the opening and closing element/tag.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>CRITICAL DIFFERENCES</span><br />
        A class differs from an id in that it can be repeated anywhere in that
        HTML document/page by simply adding the class to the opening
        element/tag. However an id is unique and is scoped "globally" for that
        HTML document/page. In simple terms, you can repeat a class within an
        HTML document/page but an id can only appear once within an HTML
        document/page.
        <br />
        <br />
        This unique id also provides an additional function for HTML. If you
        want to provide naviagation links to specific part of a page, you can
        use the unique id as the target for that link!
        <br />
        <br />
        Additionally, you could, if necessary, provide an element/tag with BOTH
        an id and a class. This should be rare and will only happen in very
        specific use cases.
        <br />

        <!-- HTML CODE -->
        <span id="html">HTML Code Example</span><br />
        To assign a class and/or an id in HTML find the "opening" element/tag
        you want it to apply to and add the class and/or an id. This allows CSS
        or JavaScript to find it on the HTML page and apply the effect to the
        page that the end user views or interacts with. To apply a class in HTML
        the code would look something like this:
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="../images/class-html-code.png"
          alt="Code snippet showing a class added to an HTML element"
          class="code-snippet"
        />
        <br />
        <img
          src="../images/id-html-code.png"
          alt="Code snippet showing an id added to an HTML element"
          class="code-snippet"
        />
        <br />
        To use the id for naviagating within a page you supply the id to the
        anchor (link) element/tag as its href (reference). That code would look
        like this:
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="../images/id-nav-html-code.png"
          alt="Code snippet showing a class added to an HTML element"
          class="code-snippet"
        />
        <br />
        <!-- CSS CODE -->
        <span id="css">CSS Code Example</span><br />
        CSS will then "look" for the class and/or id to apply the styling. For
        CSS to find a class and/or id in the HTML document the code would look
        something like this:
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>CSS CLASS</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="../images/class-css-code.png"
          alt="Code snippet showing a class in CSS"
          class="code-snippet"
        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>CSS ID</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="../images/id-css-code.png"
          alt="Code snippet showing an id in CSS"
          class="code-snippet"
        />

        <span id="best">BEST PRACTICE</span> <br />
        To be effective using class and id in website development, one has to be
        able to look at their site as a whole. While it is possible to repeat an
        id in separate HTML documents, ids can also conflict with JavaScript
        functions. It is a best practice to make ids globally unique to the
        entire site and not just the HTML document. This may not be practical
        for very large sites, so having strong documentation of the unique ids
        used on the site is critically important so that ids can be reused in
        separate HTML documents for CSS styling purposes and not create
        JavaScript conflicts.
        <br /><br />
        To determine if you should use a class or an id answer several
        questions:
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>HTML</span>
        <br />
        <span>Q:</span> Is this the only time this element will appear on the
        page? <br /><br />If the answer is yes then an id will be appropriate.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>Q:</span> Will I need to provide a navigation link to this part of
        the page? <br /><br />If the answer is yes then an id will be
        appropriate.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>CSS</span>
        <br />
        <span>Q:</span> Do I need to repeat this styling elsewhere?
        <br /><br />If the answer is yes then a class will be appropriate.
        <br /><br />
        <span>Q:</span> Is this the only time this will appear on a page?
        <br /><br />If the answer is yes then an id will be appropriate.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>JS</span>
        <br />
        <span>Q:</span> Will JavaScript be the only thing using this id to
        manipulate the HMTL document? <br /><br />If the answer is yes then an
        id will be appropriate. <br /><br />
