        Classes and IDs provide similar but different functions that provide
        powerful funtions for the interaction between HTML and CSS.

        to an element provides you with the ability to apply specific CSS or
        JavaScript effects to the web page shown in general, a specific section
        ro multiple places. A class differs from an ID in that it can be
        repeated anywhere you choose by simply adding the class to the element.

        <span>HTML Code Example</span><br />
        To assign a class in HTML you would find the "opening" element or tag
        you want it to apply to and add the class so that your CSS or JavaScript
        can find it and apply its effect to the page that the end user interacts
        with. That code would look something like this:
        <br />
        <br />
        <img
          src="../images/class-html-code.png"
          alt="Code snippet showing a class added to an HTML element"
          class="code-snippet"
        />
