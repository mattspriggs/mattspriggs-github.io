        Emotional intelligence is the practical application of one's mental
        ability to understand, respond to, regulate and accept emotions within
        oneself, another person and how those emotions and response fit into a
        culture as a whole.

          "IQ, short for intelligence quotient, is a measure of a person’s
          reasoning ability. In short, it is supposed to gauge how well someone
          can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions.
          IQ tests begin to assess this by measuring short- and long-term
          memory. They also measure how well people can solve puzzles and recall
          information they’ve heard — and how quickly."</span

        Given these two definitions, <span>IQ</span> is measuring the logical
        portion of a person's mental abilities. It is not, contrary to popular
        belief, something set in stone. One's ability to reason and to
        efficiently solve things is trainable. In a way it is analogous to
        scientific discipline. <br /><br />
        <span>EQ</span>, on the other hand, is one's mental ability to
        understand their own emotions and how they respond to emotions as well
        as being able to recognize, respond to, accept and understand another
        person emotions and responsiveness. The closest analogy for EQ would be
        creative or artistic discipline.

    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        <span>EQ</span> is critically important to working within a
        community/organization/team/family. A strong EQ provides for better,
        more positive interactions with others and fosters collaboration which I
        believe is a huge part of being a successful human.
