        In coding not all problems are complex.  However, simple problems can turn into something complex in your mind.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        While coding a more complex piece of code I developed a solution that would work when run outside of testing and would give me the expected result.  I spent a bunch of time trying to understand why the test would continual fail.  After trying several things I had to step back and realize that I was too close to it to see what the problem was.  There we no error messages to read, I was getting the correct output and I just couldn't find the problem.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        To solve the problem I tried using the console log function to review the output.  When the output from the console log was what was expected I stepped back and tried talking through the problem to my imaginary co-coder, the Rubber Duck method, and arrived at the same solution.  When those things failed to resolve the issue I broke down and posted my question with my code and test results to the tech-questions channel in Discord and waited for someone to save me from myself.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A minute later another cohort member pointed out that I had a typo in a variable name - testscores instead of testScores.  Once I made this simple change the test passed with no issues.  So while the error was so small, it still stopped me dead in my tracks.  The lesson learned is, when you get the output that you expect but you can't get it to pass a test, review the code for spelling and case errors and if you can't find it, ask for a kindly set of eyes to look it over.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In short, when in doubt ask for someone else to take a look.

    <h2 class="subheading" id="elegant">Elegant Solution Example</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        I created a problem for myself in a function which was supposed to take in a sentence as a string and then return that sentence as a string with each word capitalized.  
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I worked out what I needed to do in pseudocode and tried to make it work.  After a while I tried several ways to get the correct output and when I failed I decided to Google some examples.  I looked at what I was doing and tried to revise my code to yield the solution I needed.  When that failed I decided to get up, take a walk and come back.  When I came back I looked at the solution I had written and saw that I was breaking the steps into parts that were too large and created undefined output in the console log. I remembered that methods can be chained together and it flowed quickly and resulted in the output I needed.  I considered this elegant in that once my mind got into the right place, the solution flowed easily and cleanly with concise, readable code that was self documenting. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        At first I felt frustrated with not getting output I expected and could not understand why the output was undefined and the filer method I was using was not firing.  As I got more frustrated the code got more convoluted as I tried different things.  When I finally determined I was too stuck to make progress and needed to get perspective I stepped back and let the problem flow in the back of mind as I did other things.  When I was in the right frame of mind the solution appeared and flowed eaily and cleanly.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        From this examination of my problem solving, I realize that I need to be conscious of when my frustration is overriding my ability to think clearly, I will benefit from getting up from the keyboard and letting the possible solution work through my mind until I am in a clearer state and able to view the problem and solution without the interference of my frustration.

    <div class="section">
      <ul class="paragraph">
        <li>
          <span>Pseudocode</span> is essential for problem solving, especially when I am trying to do something new or something that I haven't done for while.  This is technique is something I am comfortable with but need to use more often.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Trying something</span> is my intitial go to when I feel like I know what needs to be done.  I will jump into the problem and try what I remember.  Sometimes this works.  Often it will give me a good start on a solution.  Occassionally I will get off on the wrong foot and it forces me to rethink my approach and usually I step back and then start with pseudocode.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Rubber ducky method</span> is a technique that I use particularly when I am working with other people.  I should use it more often when I am working solo because saying the solution out loud often helps me see what needs to be done differently.  This is a technique that I need to implement more when working alone but is common when I am working in a pair or team.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Reading error messages</span> is so very helpful to me.  Often using the stack trace will point me to the precise location of the error and through pattern recognition I can sometimes quickly see the problem and easily fix the bug.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Console.logging</span> is another essential tool for me in my problem solving kit.  I frequently will pop a console.log() into my code to make sure I am getting what I expect out of my code.  I can't imagine not using this technique when coding.  It's the window that lets one see what the computer sees.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Googling</span> is the king of syntax help.  If I don't know or can't recall how to do something, Googling is the go to tool.  In particualr using the Mozzilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation is particularly helpful as is Stack Overlfow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Asking your peers for help</span> is something I feel comfortable with but can be resistant too.  I tend to want to "solve it myself" which can be inefficient.  I need to become better at this.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Asking coaches for help</span> like asking peers for help, this is something I feel comfortable with but can be resistant too and is always my last line of problem solving.  I tend to want to "solve it myself" which can be inefficient.  I need to become better at this.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Improving your process with reflection</span> is something I use and am comfortable with but need to get better at implementing in a more timely fashion.  It works really well for me but my stubbornness and deisre to "solve it now" gets in the way as does my ego.  What I have to realize is that I am not giving up, I am simply stepping away and then mentally working on it without distraction.
        </li>

    <div class="section">
      <p class="paragraph">
        When working with some more basic coding I ran into an issue where I was getting back an undefined result.  These issues are typically easier to find and solve.  In this case I ran into the problem over and over again and kept thinking "don't ask for help, you can figure it out. This isn't your first time coding. You'll look ignorant.  Only ask if you can't solve it with another solution."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This turned out to be highly inefficient and a total waste of time.  When I asked I was given the simple solution in a matter of moments but just as I asked the question I saw the solution.  Sometimes when asking the question I relax and can see the problem.  Other times I truly need the insight of someone else. In short, I need to be better at asking for help in a more timely fashion.
