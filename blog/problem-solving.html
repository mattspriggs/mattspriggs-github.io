        In coding not all problems are complex.  However, simple problems can turn into something complex in your mind.
        <br/><br/>
        While coding a more complex piece of code I developed a solution that would work when run outside of testing and would give me the expected result.  I spent a bunch of time trying to understand why the test would continual fail.  After trying several things I had to step back and realize that I was too close to it to see what the problem was.  There we no error messages to read, I was getting the correct output and I just couldn't find the problem.
        <br/><br/>
        To solve the problem I tried using the console log function to review the output.  When the output from the console log was what was expected I stepped back and tried talking through the problem to my imaginary co-coder, the Rubber Duck method, and arrived at the same solution.  When those things failed to resolve the issue I broke down and posted my question with my code and test results to the tech-questions channel in Discord and waited for someone to save me from myself.
        <br/><br/>
        A minute later another cohort member pointed out that I had a typo in a variable name - testscores instead of testScores.  Once I made this simple change the test passed with no issues.  So while the error was so small, it still stopped me dead in my tracks.  The lesson learned is, when you get the output that you expect but you can't get it to pass a test, review the code for spelling and case errors and if you can't find it, ask for a kindly set of eyes to look it over.
        <br/><br/>
        In short, when in doubt ask for someone else to take a look.
