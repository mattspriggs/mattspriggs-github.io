        <span>Ethical Decison Example</span><br />
        When I was working in the public sector in the US as a planner and
        economic developer, I came across a number of illegal and unethical
        deals by members of the local governing body I worked for. I could have
        let it slide and kept my head down and kept my job.
        <br /><br />
        But I am <span>NOT</span> built that way. <br /><br />
        Despite being asked to provide a justification to allow for the action
        to go forward and appprove it, I provided a written document showing how
        and what would have to be done in order for it to comply with the
        zoning. Needless to say, to make it right would be expensive and there
        would be no guarantee it would be approved. In fact it most likely
        wouldn't.
        <br /><br />
        My integrity is everything to me and I was not about to be bought. I
        then spent the next 9 months being under attack by a City Councilor, the
        Mayor and the Town Manager, with an eventual attack on me personally and
        impacting my family if I didn't comply. I then resigned and the issue
        for me went away as that was what they wanted - to move me out and find
        someone who would roll over.
        <br /><br />
        Today I am happy with my decision. I did the right thing and preserved
        my integrity and moved on to bigger and better things. <br />

        <span>Culture & Mentors</span><br />
        I was fortunate to have been born into a family that had means. Both of
        my parents were very much intellectuals with my mother being a strong,
        creative and caring person and my father being a highly ethical person,
        very logical and with a great sense of humor with an intense interest in
        fairness. I was allowed to explore my interests and was
        encouraged/required to be athletic and scholarly.
        <br /><br />
        As an adult I have been fortunate to have three mentors who have had a
        huge impact on who I am.
        <br /><br />
        Professionally, the director I worked for early in my planning career
        (Charlie Flynn) molded and focussed my strengths and tempered my flaws -
        making me very adept at collaboration, creative problem solving, and
        expressing ideas to all sorts of audiences with clarity and
        understandability.
        <br /><br />
        My Aikido sensei, Russell Jones, taught me about how to read people,
        create harmony and embrace spirituality in a real and dynamic way.
        Getting thrown and throwing people is also a LOT of fun!
        <br /><br />
        My final mentor, an elder contractor, Tad Stanley, taught me all about
        relationships with others and with myself. This is not to be under rated
        in its importance!
