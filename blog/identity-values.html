        <span id="ethical">Ethical Decison Example</span><br />
        When I was working in the public sector in the US as a planner and
        economic developer, I came across a number of illegal and unethical
        deals by members of the local governing body I worked for. I could have
        let it slide and kept my head down and kept my job.
        <br /><br />
        But I am <span>NOT</span> built that way. <br /><br />
        Despite being asked to provide a justification to allow for the action
        to go forward and appprove it, I provided a written document showing how
        and what would have to be done in order for it to comply with the
        zoning. Needless to say, to make it right would be expensive and there
        would be no guarantee it would be approved. In fact it most likely
        wouldn't.
        <br /><br />
        My integrity is everything to me and I was not about to be bought. I
        then spent the next 9 months being under attack by a City Councilor, the
        Mayor and the Town Manager, with an eventual attack on me personally and
        impacting my family if I didn't comply. I then resigned and the issue
        for me went away as that was what they wanted - to move me out and find
        someone who would roll over.
        <br /><br />
        Today I am happy with my decision. I did the right thing and preserved
        my integrity and moved on to bigger and better things. <br />

        I was fortunate to have been born into a family that had means. Both of
        my parents were very much intellectuals with my mother being a strong,
        creative and caring person and my father being a highly ethical person,
        very logical and with a great sense of humor with an intense interest in
        fairness. I was allowed to explore my interests and was
        encouraged/required to be athletic and scholarly.
        <br /><br />
        As an adult I have been fortunate to have three mentors who have had a
        huge impact on who I am.
        <br /><br />
        Professionally, the director I worked for early in my planning career,
        <span>Charlie Flynn</span>, molded and focussed my strengths and tempered my flaws -
        making me very adept at collaboration, creative problem solving, and
        expressing ideas to all sorts of audiences with clarity and
        understandability.
        <br /><br />
        My Aikido sensei, <span>Russell Jones</span>, taught me about how to read people,
        create harmony and embrace spirituality in a real and dynamic way.
        Getting thrown and throwing people is also a LOT of fun!
        <br /><br />
        My final mentor, an elder contractor, <span>Tad Stanley</span>, taught me all about
        relationships with others and with myself. This is not to be under rated
        in its importance!

        <span id="strength">Strengths & Learning</span><br />  
        <ul class="paragraph">
        <li><span>Persistence:</span> Being persistent allows me to continue to
        take on the problems one encounters in learning and overcoming the tough
        concepts.</li>
       <li><span>Logical:</span> Logical thinking lets me step back and
        break the problem into its components and the smaller problems that are
        more easily solved.</li>
        <li><span>Creative:</span>  My creativity lets me think outside the box and try
          new and different approaches (with my perserverance allowing me to fail
          and iterate on the ideas before abandoning them).</li> 
          <li><span>Inqusitive:</span> My inquisitveness leads to my desire to find out the essential
          "why" or root of the problem by taking in as many perspectives as
          possible to fashion my solution.</li>
          <li><span>Assertive:</span> Lastly, my
        assertiveness lets me jump into solving issues without hesitation and
        bring others with me to tackle things as a group (when appropriate).</li>
      </ul>

        I can, at times, jump into solving a problem before carefully considering the actual cause. 
        <br/><br/>
        This can lead to a circuitous route that eventually arrives at a soution but is not as efficient or as effective as it could have been. 
        <br/><br/>
        If I step back, took a deep breath and am attentive to understanding the real problem, the solution is often more effective and efficient.  Sometimes I value immediacy too much and can be costly in terms of time and effectiveness.

        I was working as the lead planner on a massive environmental restorartion project that came under fire from the massive local agriculture industry. We met with a number of representatives from the farming industry and my Director opened with "We understand you are concerned about our project and how it might impact you.  Can you please tell us about those concerns?"   
        <br/><br/>
        The farmers launched into paranoid and untrue statements as though they were facts.  Being young, knowledgeable and having a very strong desire to set the record straight, I launched into telling them how all of their concerns were not true and shouldn't concern them. 
        <br/><br/>
        My Director squeezed thigh so hard that it left a bruise and I promptly shut up.  Charlie went on to smooth things over and explore their concerns and, most importantly, made sure that they felt HEARD.  
        <br/><br/>
        Later, as the emotions lowered and the fearful reactions subsided, we were able to address their concerns and take them from obstructing our project to lobbying for it in Congress to get federal funding.
        <br/><br/>
        What is a shame is that at the time I was trained as a mediator but completely left those skills outside of the room and was more interested in being right than in developing rapoire and understanding. Today I have many experiences with creating collaboration and cooperation.  
        <br/><br/>
        The Steven Covey quote comes to mind when working with others <span>"seek to understand before seeking to be understood".</span>  This approach has been very helpful in my later success.  People cannot hear anything other than what they believe if they don't feel understood.
