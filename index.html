      <p class="paragraph">
        A late career professional taking a bold leap into the tech sector in an
        unfamiliar country as a new immigrant. I enjoy change and challenge and
        have been a part of creating and implementing change throughout my
        entire career. This is a bit different; it is a huge level of personal
        change and challenge but one that I want, despite finding unexpected
        difficulties. I try, to the best of my abilities, to turn those
        difficulties into opportunities for growth.
